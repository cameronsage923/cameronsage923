# 👋 Hi, I’m Cameron Oglesby.

I’m a Finance major at the University of Notre Dame, graduating in May 2025, with a strong interest in **private equity**, **real estate**, and **data-driven storytelling**.

Through coursework and self-directed projects, I’ve developed skills in **Python**, **Streamlit**, **pandas**, **Excel modeling**, and some **SQL**— and I enjoy building interactive tools that bridge finance and technology.
